# **Qobloqc Client**

Welcome! idk what to put here lol

The Qobloqc Client is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. For more information, see the LICENSE.txt file included within this repository.
Please note that we are currently not looking for contributors, so any pull requests will be ignored.

Also, only Windows is officially supported at the moment. If you're using Linux, you can *try* using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) or [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton), but I haven't tested it and I have no idea if that is going to work at all, so do it at your own risk.

And that's all you need to know about Qobloqc, so go ahead and try it out! When it eventually becomes actually playable. One day.
